## pboyd.io

These are the source files for my [personal blog](https://pboyd.io). I'm making it public to track changes made to posts after initial publication.

This site was online from 2018 to 2024, and then I took it down. I brought it back with most of the original content in January 2026. The Git history only goes back to the 2026 reboot.

If you disagree with something I've written, feel free to open an issue and we can discuss it. I also happily accept [emails](paul@pboyd.io). Pull requests for spelling and minor grammar problems will be accepted (and appreciated!), but will otherwise be rejected.
