What would happen if the one engineer who really knows how it all works in your company were hit by a bus? I've never lost a coworker to a bus accident, but given how often I've heard the question, thousands of developers must die every year beneath the wheels of a bus. Yet we only focus on limiting the impact of losing that single precious engineer. I say, enough! We have to stop losing developers this way. Even a developer who isn't a single point of failure deserves to make it to the other side of the street. To that end, I've prepared the following flowchart to help our would-be roadkill cross the street.
