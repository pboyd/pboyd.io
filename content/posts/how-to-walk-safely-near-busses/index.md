What would happen if the single engineer who really knows how it all works in your company were hit by a bus? I have fortunately never had a co-worker meet such an untimely end, but as often as I've heard this question I must assume there is an epidemic of software developers being hit by busses. And yet, we only seem concerned about limiting the impact of losing that single precious engineer. I say, enough! It's unacceptable for us to continue losing engineers like thise. Even an engineer who isn't a single point of failure deserves to make it to the other side of the street. To that end, I've prepared the following flowchart to help our would-be roadkill cross the street.
