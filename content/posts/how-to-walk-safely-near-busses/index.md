What would happen if the single engineer who really knows how it all works in your company were hit by a bus? Fortunately, I've never lost a coworker to a bus accident. But as often as I've heard the question, I have to assume that thousands of software developers die every year beneath the wheels of a bus. And yet, on the whole, we only seem to care about limiting the impact of losing that single precious engineer. I say, enough! We have to stop losing developers like this. Even a developer who isn't a single point of failure deserves to make it to the other side of the street. To that end, I've prepared the following flowchart to help our would-be roadkill cross the street.
