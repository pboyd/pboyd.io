I'm Paul Boyd, a mostly self-taught software developer who currently works at Red Hat. I have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-boyd-6307b139/) if you want to connect.

The source to this site is [published on GitHub](https://github.com/pboyd/pboyd.io).

## AI usage

I write all the text and always will. However, I do use AI in the following ways:

- **Proofreading** &mdash; On older articles, I used Grammarly to find grammatical errors and simplify the text. I currently use Claude Code in the same way ([elements-of-style](https://github.com/obra/the-elements-of-style/)!).
- **Generating code** &mdash; I sometimes use AI to generate code examples or to build projects I write about.
- **Generating artwork** &mdash; I'm a terrible artist. If it's not a diagram, a photograph, or badly cobbled together clip-art, it's AI-generated. I'll note this in the image caption.
- **Other** &mdash; Researching, brainstorming, and generating the non-content parts of the site (templates, deployment scripts, etc.)
