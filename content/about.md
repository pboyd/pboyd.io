This blog is written by me, Paul Boyd, just your average software developer.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/pboyd/). I avoid social media, but I have a limited presence on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-boyd-6307b139/).

The best way to reach me is [email](mailto:paul@pboyd.io).

## Disclosures

Everything on this site is my own opinion, and does not necessarily reflect the views of my employers (past or present).

## AI usage

The text of the articles on this site are not AI generated and never will be. However, AI will be used for the following:

- **Proofreading** &emdash; I used Grammarly in the past to find grammatical errors and find simpler ways to write. Now I use Claude.
- **Generating code** &emdash; I may use AI to generate the code examples or in the production of the projects I write about.
- **Generating artwork** &emdash; I'm a terrible artist. If it's not a diagram or a photograph, it's probably AI generated. It will be stated in the image caption.
- **Research** &emdash; Generative AI has become a tool that I use to learn new things.
