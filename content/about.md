This blog is written by me, Paul Boyd, just your average backend web app developer.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/pboyd/). I avoid social media, but I have a limited presence on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-boyd-6307b139/).

The best way to contact me is by [email](mailto:paul@pboyd.io).
